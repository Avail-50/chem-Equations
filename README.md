# chem-Equations

### Splits chemistry equations into reactants and products and each element
# In future will balance the equation for you

vague algorithm, will test later

split all parts of equation into elements \n
find amount of fisrt element in reactants
in product, total amout of that element
product total / reactant total = ans
all product containg element / ans

^ will only work in v specific scearios
