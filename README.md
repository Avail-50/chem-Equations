# chem-Equations

## I gave up

### Splits chemistry equations into reactants and products and each element
# In future will ~~balance the equation for you~~   work

To Do:
1. last thing (add reconstruct function to  output, needs to combine float and elements and add elements)

2. fix addToEqu
   
3. more complicated eg. balancing by 2 on one side and three on other T-T

4. test more:
