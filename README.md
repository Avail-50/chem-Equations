# chem-Equations

### Splits chemistry equations into reactants and products and each element
# In future will ~~balance the equation for you~~   work

To Do:
1. last thing (add reconstruct function to  output, needs to combine float and elements and add elements)

2. fix addToEqu
   
3. redo execution part of code to check whethter reactant or product is being balanced

4. test more:
